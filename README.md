📌 The Big Picture

📦 What Sells Best?
Among 16 item categories, Fruits & Vegetables and Snacks tied for the top-selling spots at $180K each. Household items and frozen foods followed, indicating a strong preference for daily essentials. Interestingly, niche categories like Starchy Foods and Others saw minimal sales (~$20K), providing an opportunity for promotional strategies.

🧈 The Fat Content Factor
Customer preferences were split, but Regular fat content products dominated with $776K in sales, compared to $425K for Low Fat. However, a deeper look revealed that in Tier 3 outlets, Low Fat products actually outsold Regular ones — hinting at demographic-driven health trends worth tapping into.

🗺️ Location
When broken down by outlet location:
•	Tier 3 outlets outperformed all with $472K in sales,
•	Followed by Tier 2 at $393K,
•	And Tier 1 at $336K.
This suggests that Tier 3 cities, often overlooked, are Blinkit's most lucrative markets. These areas may be benefiting from less competition and higher demand for quick delivery services.

🏪 Size & Outlet Type Performance
Outlet size directly correlated with performance:
•	High-size outlets delivered $508K, nearly double that of small-sized ones.
•	Supermarkets were the dominant outlet type, generating over $780K and moving 5,577 items, while grocery stores and niche formats lagged.
This clearly indicates that larger, well-stocked stores are key drivers of          revenue for Blinkit.

📈 Time Tells a Tale
From 2010 to 2020, sales trends initially rose, peaking in 2018 at $205K, before facing a slight decline. This could point to market saturation or new competition, signaling the need for innovation or revitalized outreach in recent years.
